Implementing Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks in Tensorflow

The aim of the project is to implement the forward pass from scratch for a LSTM using Tensorflow.

The implementation covers the following points:
  1. Workflow for building and using the computational graph in Tensorflow
  2. LSTM implementation and application
  3. How to create summaries in Tensorflow. There is an example of manually adding summaries as well.
  4. Training word embeddings as an additional layer in the front of the NN
  5. Visualizing and adding word embeddings to Tensorboard
  6. Implementation of mini-batching, padding for NLP tasks

The project implements a simple Sentiment Analysis Classifier using Kaggle Sentiment Analysis competition data.
